# What is this Word Quiz game?

It is a 2 player/ 2 group game. one player/group starts the game by saying a word and then other player/group has to respond with a word starting with last letter of word that first group said. like:
```
player1/group1: says word "apple"
player2/group2: responds with a word "egg", as it starts with last letter of word "apple", i.e. "e".

player1/group1: responds with "gun", as it starts with last letter of word "egg", i.e. "g".
